This Python code serves the purpose of validating and converting a date input into the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
This program is designed to repeatedly prompt the user for a date input until a valid date in one of the supported formats is provided. 
Once a valid date is entered, it converts and prints it in the 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
