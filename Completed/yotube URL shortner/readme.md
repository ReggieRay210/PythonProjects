This Python code is a basic tool for extracting YouTube video URLs from HTML content, specifically focusing on embedded videos within <iframe> tags. It showcases the use of regular expressions for pattern matching and string manipulation techniques in Python.

User Interaction: The application prompts the user to input HTML content. This HTML content may contain embedded YouTube video URLs within <iframe> tags.

Parsing HTML: The application parses the input HTML using regular expressions to search for <iframe> tags. If an '<iframe>' tag is found, it will extract the URL of the embedded YouTube video using another regular expression pattern.

URL Modification: Once the YouTube video URL is extracted, the application modifies it from the embed format to the regular YouTube URL format. This involves replacing the embed domain with the regular YouTube domain and removing the unnecessary parameters.

Output: Finally, the application returns the modified YouTube video URL. If no YouTube video URL is found in the input HTML, it returns None.
